# Project-for-predicting-house-price-in-Airbnb

Project introduction:
Pricing plays an important role in the sharing economy of the industry such as Airbnb as it affects the accommodation choices of the guests and also significantly affects the profits of the hosts. In this project, our key target is to study the pricing problem of Airbnb in New South Wales, Sydney to maximize the profits of hosts, companies and stakeholders. 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Learning has been done to the database to eliminate extraneous elements and to standardise data. Both non-linear and linear models were covered in the project and models are compared with each other to find the most efficient model.
